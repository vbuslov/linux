Changes V1 -> V2:

- Rename DEVLINK_SLICE_RATE_NODE to DEVLINK_SLICE_RATE_TYPE_NODE.

- Rename RATE_GROUP_NAME_LEN to RATE_NODE_NAME_LEN.

- Rename DEVLINK_ATTR_SLICE_RATE_GROUP_NAME to
DEVLINK_ATTR_SLICE_RATE_NODE_NAME.

- Use unified devlink_slice_rate_notify() for slice rate group
notifications instead of devlink_slice_rate_group_notify() dedicated
specifically for groups.

- Don't require rate object type when getting/setting rate object
parameters.

- Use struct devlink_slice_rate as representation of both rate leaf and
node objects. Unify functions to work with devlink_slice_rate structure
instead of having dedicated function implementations for leafs and nodes.

- Store both rate leafs and nodes in info->user_ptr[0] as unified
devlink_slice_rate structure when receiving them from user space.

- Move rate ops from dedicated structure to devlink ops and replace "group"
with "node" in their names.

- Call ops->node_group_del() after generating delete notification in
devlink_slice_node_group_del() to prevent use after free.

- Always destroy devlink_slice_rate->priv with
devlink_slice_rate->priv_destuctor() instead of assuming that the driver
performs cleanup in ops->node_group_del().

- Implement function devlink_slice_rate_node_destroy_all() that is intended
to be used by drivers to cleanup all devlink slice rate groups before
deleting the devlink instance.

- Implement helpers devlink_slice_is{leaf|node}() intended to be used by
supporting drivers to check devlink_slice_rate type.

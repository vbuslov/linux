Changes V1 -> V2:

- Use struct devlink_slice_rate as representation of both rate leaf and
node objects. Unify functions to work with devlink_slice_rate structure
instead of having dedicated function implementations for leafs and nodes.

- Move rate ops from dedicated structure to devlink ops and replace "group"
with "node" in their names.

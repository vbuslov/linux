Changes V1 -> V2:

- Move driver callbacks from slice.c to dev.c where all other netdevsim
devlink_ops callbacks are defined.

- Change naming of netdevsim devlink ops functions according to changed
callback ops names.

- Use new struct devlink_slice_rate as representation of rate object.

- Don't deallocate devlink_rate->priv manually. Defer to devlink API to use
priv_destructor instead.

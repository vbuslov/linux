Changes V1 -> V2:

- Rename DEVLINK_SLICE_RATE_LEAF to DEVLINK_SLICE_RATE_TYPE_LEAF.

- Implement function devlink_slice_rate_notify() and
DEVLINK_CMD_SLICE_RATE_{NEW|DEL} commands and use them for notifications
when creating/deleting leaf rate object instead of putting rate object info
into notification messages for slice object themselves.

- Remove rate ops as implicit API for creating rate leaf when creating
slice. Instead, provide dedicated
devlink_slice_rate_leaf_{create|destroy}() API to create/destroy new struct
devlink_slice_rate instances.

- Define new struct devlink_slice_rate and use it as representation of rate
object.

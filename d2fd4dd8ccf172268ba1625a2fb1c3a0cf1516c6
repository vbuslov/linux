Changes V1 -> V2:

- Rename DEVLINK_SLICE_RATE_LEAF to DEVLINK_SLICE_RATE_TYPE_LEAF.

- Don't require rate object type when setting rate object parameters.

- Use new struct devlink_slice_rate as representation of rate object.

- Move rate ops from dedicated structure to devlink ops and rename them to
start with "rate_" prefix to distinguish them from other devlink ops
callback names.
